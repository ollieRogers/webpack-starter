# Webpack starter

### development

```
npm run dev
```

When in development webpack will hot reload your build and give you a source map. 

Development build will be available on `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/static/index.html`.


### Build for production

```
npm run build
```

This compiles your project to `/build`. You can send it where you want after that.
